# EEG Signal Simulator

This project generates artificial EEG signals (alpha, beta, and theta waves) along with noise. The signal is visualized in both time and frequency domains.

## Features
- Simulate EEG signals with alpha, beta, and theta waves.
- Visualize the signal in both time and frequency domains.
- Save plots as PNG images in the `/plots/` directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhanailyas/eeg-signal-simulator.git
